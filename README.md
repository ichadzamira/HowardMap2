  
  Phase 2
  
  
  In Phase two the goal was to make the map become more real. 
  In order to do this I would have to use a database and store table of information relating the map there. 
  I had to use the PostgresSQL tool PgAdmin to access the database and use tables to further production of the map. 
  These tables were going to describe the node and identify the nodes location. 
  This would then help the map to be more user friendly.
